# TrainingProjects

--- DESCRIPTION ---

This is my training project.

I am still learning the basics of modern Web pages.In this project,i am following a Youtube video and applying instructions.So it makes me familiar with Web development.

Youtube video link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TId6holGVeY

--- METHOD ---

As i follow the instructions from the Youtube video,at the meantime i am trying to practice 
what i am learning,for instance:

#In the CSS file,instructor set the "display:Block" for an inline element.For a deeper understanding,i am researching inline elements and getting more details about: 

*What are these elements
*Differences from the block level elements
*What happens after i set "display: inline-block" for inline elements 



#In the CSS file,instructor write these codes: 

*input[type=text],input[type=email] --- CSS Attribute Selectors
*input::placeholder --- Pseudo-element
*nav ul li a:hover --- Pseudo-class

So i am asking myself "What are these? What are the differences? Where can we use these codes properly?" and make a detailed reserach about them.

etc.. This is how i learn the details further.
